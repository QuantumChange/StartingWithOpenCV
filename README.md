# About This Reposit

As we all know openCV is a great library in python for image processing.
These jupyter notebooks will give a quick start with openCV image processing.

ImageRecon.ipynb will be the first notebook to start.

It will tell you how to load a image, resize the image, flip it, open that image in new window and save your image object.
Also some 2D primitive drawing over image you are processing
